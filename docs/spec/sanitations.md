# Sanitation for OpenAPI specification

This document describes the modifications and enhancements made to the OpenAPI specification for `salesforce.marketingcloud`.
Because there is no official OpenAPI specification, the spec was generated by converting the [Salesforce Marketing Cloud Postman Collection](https://www.postman.com/salesforce-developers/salesforce-developers/folder/hs55w6u/rest). While the Postman collection provided a solid starting point, it lacked many parameters and response structures. These gaps were filled by manually adding the required details and making further adjustments to improve usability and address known language limitations.

**Note:** Only a subset of APIs was implemented, as adding all parameter and response types required significant manual effort.

Sanitation steps applied:
1. Added `OAuth2` credential security schema.
2. Retained only the endpoints selected for implementation.
3. Removed authentication endpoints.
4. Removed discovery endpoints.
5. Added parameters and response structures, keeping only the minimum required fields with `additionalParameters` set to true.
6. Ran `bal openapi align` and `bal openapi flatten` commands.
7. Add `operationId` for the paths.
 
## OpenAPI cli command

The following command was used to generate the Ballerina client from the OpenAPI specification. The command should be executed from the repository root directory.

```bash
bal openapi -i docs/spec/openapi.json -o ballerina --mode client --client-methods remote --license docs/license.txt
```
Note: The license year is hardcoded to 2025, change if necessary.

## Sanitation for Generated Client

The following changes were made to the generated client to support multi-tenancy in the Marketing Cloud APIs:

1. The `serviceUrl` client parameter was removed and replaced with a required `subDomain` parameter to better represent tenant-specific endpoints.
   ```ballerina
   // Before
   public isolated function init(ConnectionConfig config, string serviceUrl = "https://{{et_subdomain}}.rest.marketingcloudapis.com") returns error? {
   // After
   public isolated function init(string subDomain, ConnectionConfig config) returns error? {
   ```

2. The `serviceUrl` and `auth` values are now dynamically constructed within the `init` method using the provided `subDomain`.
   ```ballerina
   // Before
   http:ClientConfiguration httpClientConfig = {auth: config.auth, ...};
   // After
   string serviceUrl = string `https://${subDomain}.rest.marketingcloudapis.com`;
   http:ClientConfiguration httpClientConfig = {auth: getUpdatedAuthConfig(config.auth, subDomain), ...};
   ```

3. The authentication configuration in `types.bal` (`OAuth2ClientCredentialsGrantConfig`) was updated to allow overriding the `credentialBearer` property, enabling tenant-specific credential management.
   ```ballerina
   // Before
   public type OAuth2ClientCredentialsGrantConfig record {| 
       *http:OAuth2ClientCredentialsGrantConfig;
       # Token URL
       string tokenUrl = "https://{{et_subdomain}}.auth.marketingcloudapis.com/v2/token";
   |};

   // After
   public type OAuth2ClientCredentialsGrantConfig record {| 
       *http:OAuth2ClientCredentialsGrantConfig;
       # Credential Bearer type to use for the request
       oauth2:CredentialBearer credentialBearer = oauth2:POST_BODY_BEARER;
       # Token Url
       string tokenUrl = "";
       # The member ID (MID) of your Marketing Cloud account
       string accountId?;
   |};
   ```

4. Introduced a new `utils_additional.bal` file for supplementary utility functions.
